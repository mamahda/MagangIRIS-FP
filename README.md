# Final Project Internship at IRIS ITS

This project is part of my **IRIS ITS** internship, where I developed a **ROS-based control system** for a **soccer robot** with **omni-wheel drive**. The robot is capable of moving on a soccer field, using **PID control** to accurately adjust its movement and maintain stability.

Key features of the project include:

- **PID Control**: Ensures precise control of the robot's speed and direction.
- **Ball Handling**: The robot can **hold**, **unhold**, and **shoot** a ball, adding functionality for soccer-related tasks.
- **Omni-wheel Movement**: The robot moves smoothly and efficiently in any direction, making it ideal for a soccer field.

This project aims to provide a robust control system for a soccer robot, enabling it to perform real-time movements, interact with the ball, and navigate the field effectively.
